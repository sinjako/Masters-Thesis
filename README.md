Work folder is a folder that has a lot of the random stuff i have worked on. My scripts expect to pull data from a folder called Data, which has subfolders called the names of the various databases.
These subfolders should have the relevant files in them named after the type they are, for example dev_numu_train_005.db should be renamed to just Data.db and its containing folder should retain the information about the run instead.
